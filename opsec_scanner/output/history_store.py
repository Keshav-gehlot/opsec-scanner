"""
Scan history store.

A SOC's defining trait isn't any single alert — it's continuous
monitoring with a history, so trends and new-vs-resolved findings are
visible over time. Everything built so far was one-shot: run a scan,
get a report, done. This module is what turns repeated runs into a
history the Ops Center dashboard can actually show trends from.

Storage is deliberately simple: one JSON file per snapshot in a local
directory (default ./.opsec-scan/history/), no database, no server —
consistent with the tool's local-first design. A snapshot is a summary
of one scan (counts by risk label, per-finding fingerprints, timestamp,
target label) — not the full finding detail, which stays in the
regular HTML/JSON/PDF/SARIF exports for that run.
